# CS5785 Project
**Grace Meyers, Aneesha Tamang, Kelly Wang**

We are participating in the **DengAI: Predicting Disease Spread** competition, hosted by DrivenData. For this project milestone, our goal is to identify the most effective machine learning models and methods to predict the number of dengue fever cases in two Latin American cities -San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Iquitos, Peru- using environmental data. We are leveraging real-world data from these locations provided by DrivenData to build accurate predictive models. By doing so, we aim to enhance our understanding of dengue fever and its environmental triggers, potentially informing public health strategies to combat dengue and other related diseases.
